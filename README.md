Therapy Bot Template
Automatically synced with your v0.dev deployments

This repository provides a template for a therapy bot, built using v0.dev, Vercel, and Grok from xAI. The application features mental health exercises such as a mindful breathing exercise, a gratitude journal, and a color therapy tool, designed to promote relaxation and emotional well-being. The project is automatically synced with your deployed chats on v0.dev, and any changes made to the deployed app will be pushed to this repository.
